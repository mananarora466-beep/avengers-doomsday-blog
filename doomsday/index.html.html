    <h2>🧠 Theory #5: Avengers Are Trapped in a Time Loop</h2>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/1XQZ6vM.jpg" alt="Avengers time loop comic">
    <p>
      One dark fan theory suggests the Avengers are trapped in a recursive
      time loop created by multiversal interference. Every attempt to stop
      Doomsday has already happened before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visual repetitions, déjà vu moments, and inevitable sacrifices hint
      that Doomsday is not an event — it is the end of the loop itself.

    <h2>🌌 Theory #6: Earth-616 Is the Real Villain</h2>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9H1yKzP.jpg" alt="Marvel multiverse destruction comic">
    <p>
      Many fans believe Earth-616 is destabilizing the multiverse. Almost every
      incursion begins here, making the Avengers unknowingly responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      To save reality, Earth-616 may need to be erased — meaning the Avengers
      must destroy their own universe.

    <h2>⚙️ Theory #7: Tony Stark Created the Doomsday Protocol</h2>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/B8RjJwC.jpg" alt="Iron Man AI comic art">
    <p>
      Fans speculate Tony Stark created a final contingency beyond Ultron —
      a Doomsday Protocol designed to activate when reality collapses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony doesn’t return as a man, but as a multiversal AI guardian guiding
      heroes beyond time and space.

  <article>
    <h2>🧬 Theory #8: Mutants Were Hidden to Protect Reality</h2>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/WpY0Y5Z.jpg" alt="Mutants Marvel comic">
    <p>
      Instead of suddenly appearing, mutants may have been intentionally
      hidden because their powers destabilize timelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doomsday forces their return as the last evolutionary defense against
      total multiversal collapse.
    </p>
  </article>

  <!-- THEORY 9 -->
  <article>
    <h2>👑 Theory #9: Doctor Doom Wins — On Purpose</h2>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4Yy1x6n.jpg" alt="Doctor Doom comic panel">
    <p>
      In this theory, Doctor Doom destroys most of the multiverse intentionally
      to save what remains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Avengers fail because they choose morality over survival. Doom wins
      because he chooses existence at any cost.
    </p>

  <!-- THEORY 10 -->
  <article>
    <h2>🕳️ Theory #10: Doomsday Is the MCU Reboot Point</h2>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SRr1KDn.jpg" alt="MCU reboot concept comic">
    <p>
      Doomsday may be Marvel’s soft reboot. Timelines merge, characters reset,
      but emotional memories remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allows Marvel to restart the MCU without erasing its legacy.
